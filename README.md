# European Flu Forecasting Hub
The European Flu Forecasting Hub is part of the European Respiratory Diseases Forecasting Hubs consortium (RespiCast), which combines multiple forecasting hubs for several respiratory disease indicators, including influenza-like-illness (ILI), acute respiratory infection (ARI), and COVID-19.

During the influenza season, participating teams submit weekly probabilistic forecasts from their models regarding ILI incidence for the upcoming four weeks. This data is communicated every week by the ECDC through the ERVISS report. Data is updated generally on Friday, and it reports ILI incidence related up to the previous week. Consequently, the forecasts published on the Hub on Wednesdays pertain to the previous week (for which there isn't yet a consolidated public data), the current week, and the two subsequent weeks.
