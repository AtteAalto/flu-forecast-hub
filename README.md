# European Flu Forecasting Hub
The European Flu Forecasting Hub collates weekly forecasts on ILI incidence in EU/EEA countries. To view the latest forecast visit the [Hub Website](LINK).


## Forecasting Targets and Update Frequency
During the influenza season, participating teams submit weekly probabilistic forecasts from their models regarding ILI incidence for the upcoming four weeks. This data is communicated every week by the ECDC through the ERVISS report. Data is updated generally on Friday, and it reports ILI incidence related up to the previous week. Consequently, the forecasts published on the Hub on Wednesdays pertain to the previous week (for which there isn't yet a consolidated public data), the current week, and the two subsequent weeks.

## About European Flu Forecasting Hub
The European Flu Forecasting Hub is part of the European Respiratory Diseases Forecasting Hubs consortium (RespiCast), which combines multiple forecasting hubs for several respiratory disease indicators, including influenza-like-illness (ILI), acute respiratory infection (ARI), and COVID-19. This consortium of hubs is run in collaboration between the European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC), the [ISI Foundation](https://www.isi.it/en/home), and the [London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine](https://epiforecasts.io/). Teams from anywhere in the world are invited to submit weekly forecasts for one or more disease indicators and for one or more countries. For more information visit the [RespiCast website](LINK)
